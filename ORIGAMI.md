----------------

### Intent
* Standardizing interaction models of micro transactions
	* removing rework of common DOM
	* establishing a model of event interactions
	* Improve UX with a global platform to standardize interaction
* explore dynamic construction
* potential of remote updating

		* Search
* Encompass Standard functions of Applications
	* Email Reporting

	* Content Holder Pages like About, Credits, Disclaimer, Sponsors, News Updates
3. Event Tracking
4. Page Navigation, Application Switching ( __New Mobile Header Design__ )
5. Email Reporting 


### 4th Phase Dynamics (*nice to have*)
1. Dynamic Construction of Inputs, Algorithm, Results
2. Remote Updating

-------------------------------------------------

## Potential Products
