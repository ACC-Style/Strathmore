	.texture_medium            					- medium texture have grey backgrounds that can be modified lighter and darker
	.texture_dust            					- A mostly transparent texture
	.texture_dark              					- dark texture with very little transparency 

	markup:
	<div class="{$modifiers} padding_5 border-color_black-8 border-width_1 border_solid text-center">{$modifiers}</div>
