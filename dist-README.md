# Strathmore Frame Work
## Pre Build Actions

To make the Strathmore function in your project first copy the contents of the 'dist' folder into your project. Attach your file to the CSS & JavaScripts.  You need to make these changes in and run these commands. 

    * Change the PATHS.OUTPUT var to the path of the folder that holds the copied "assets" folder. 
    * Change the PATHS.SRC var to the path of the folder that holds the copied "assets" folder.
    * Make sure Node.js is installed on your system.
    * run 'npm install gulp-cli -g' to install gulp on your system.
    * run 'npm i' to install all dependencies to build the styles.
    * add the assets/css/**/*.css to your gitignore or tfsignore to your project to not check in the compiled code.
